Ideal inputs would be paired tumor-normal\n    data from the same tissue from many patients (>15 pairs). This unsupervised\n    approach relies on the observation that oncogenes are characteristically\n    overexpressed in only a subset of tumors in the population, and may help\n    identify oncogene candidates purely based on differences in mRNA expression\n    between previously unknown subtypes.\nDepends:\n    R (>= 3.4.0)\nLicense: GPL-3\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\nSuggests:\n    knitr,\n    rmarkdown,\n    testthat,\n    RMySQL\nImports:\n    ggplot2,\n    ggrepel,\n    RColorBrewer,\n    mclust,\n    stats,\n    SummarizedExperiment\nVignetteBuilder: knitr\nbiocViews: GeneExpression, Sequencing\n",
