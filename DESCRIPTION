Description: This package helps identify mRNAs that are overexpressed in subsets
    of tumors relative to normal tissue. Ideal imputs would be paired tumor-normal
    data from the same tissue from many patients (>15 pairs). This unsupervised
    approach relies on the observation that oncogenes are characteristically
    overexpressed in only a subset of tumors in the population, and may help
    identify oncogene candidates purely based on differences in mRNA expression
    between previously unknown subtypes.
